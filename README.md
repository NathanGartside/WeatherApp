# Overview

This is a simple Java program that makes a API get request to a free weather API. I used a a few Maven libraries to make the request and to parse the data the request got. I made this program to learn more about the Java programing language.

# Development Environment

I used Java and a bunch of Maven libraries to create this program. I used the IOException library to catch any errors that might happen while making the API get request. I used the URL library to store the uRL from the free weather API website I used. I used BufferedReader, HttpURLConnection, and InputStreamReader to make the API request. I used Hashmap to store all the different weather condition codes. I used LocalDate, DateTimeFormatter, TextStyle, and Locale to convert the date into the weekday.

# Future Work

- I will better organize to make it look cleaner
- I will provide more infomation in the actual weather forecast
- I will add a user interface to the weather app so it looks better
